# Capstone-Proposal


## Please edit this README.md file based on your Capstone project idea.

## Project Title:
- Attack detection and Avoidance

## Group Members:
- Deemah Alkhudairi
- Hamad Al Suliman
- Norah Almuhaisen
- Sarah Alyami

## Objectives:
- The overarching goal is to encompass the capability of detecting cyber attacks in real-time, utilizing advanced monitoring and analysis techniques. Additionally, the objective involves the development and implementation of an automated solution that can actively anticipate and prevent potential attacks. This proactive approach aims to mitigate risks and fortify the security infrastructure, ensuring the safeguarding of critical systems and data against malicious activities. By combining real-time detection and automated prevention measures, this objective aims to create a robust defense system that effectively avoids and mitigates cyber threats in a proactive and efficient manner.
