# Expected Machine Learning / Deep Learning Algorithms:
- To accomplish the objectives of the project, the following state-of-the-art algorithms will be employed:

-VGG16: VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network known for its excellent performance in image classification tasks. By leveraging its pre-trained weights, the model can learn and extract meaningful features from the drug-related images, aiding in accurate detection.

- Faster R-CNN: The Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm is widely used for object detection tasks. It combines a region proposal network with a convolutional network to efficiently detect and localize objects of interest. Utilizing Faster R-CNN will enable the system to identify and pinpoint drug-related activities in real time.

- ResNet: ResNet is a deep residual neural network architecture that has proven to be highly effective in image recognition tasks. By utilizing ResNet, the system can learn intricate patterns and features related to drug deals, enhancing its detection capabilities.

- AlexNet: AlexNet is a deep convolutional neural network that revolutionized the field of computer vision. It has shown remarkable performance in image classification tasks. The inclusion of AlexNet in the project's algorithms will provide an additional approach for accurate drug deal detection.
