# Capstone-Proposal


## Please edit this README.md file based on your Capstone project idea.

## Project Title:
- Car damage detection system.
- Fire detection system.
- Visual deformities detection system.
- Gun detection system.

## Group Members:
- Sheikha Alobodi
- Hanadi Almoutairy
- Faris Alotibi
- Abdulmalik Alsharekh

## Objectives:
- Developing a detection system using deep learning to recognize car damages in  aims to improve the assessment process, reduce time and effort, and enhance the quality of services for customers.
- Finding an optimal way to help the civil defense in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to detect house fires and provide assistance as soon as possible to reduce the potential risks of fires.
- The  goal of the Deep Learning system for detecting visual deformities in buildings and walls is to improve error detection accuracy, to improve public safety by detecting potential risks in buildings and facilities and can be applied in vital areas such as healthcare, schools, government buildings, and public facilities.
- Gun Detection project developed using deep learning software. This system can be used in public places to monitor security and safety, such as schools, airports, airports, government and public buildings.




## Dataset Description:
- Damage and whole car images
- Fire and smoke images
- we will create our own dataset which contain clean wall and deformed wall images 
- Gun images
